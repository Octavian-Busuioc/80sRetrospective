      <cite id="cite1"><sup></sup> Don’t Stop Believin’-Journey -“Don’t Stop Believin'” was released as a single off of Journey’s hugely successful album Escape. To many, this song is considered<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">the definitive Journey track. AllMusic’s Mike DeGagne described it as “an anthem for the young who wanted to feel free and unrestricted”, whilst The Guardian’s Dorian Lynskey called it “the power ballad that refused to die”. <br><br> Although the track only reached #8 at the time of its release, it has grown more popular as the years have gone by through its use in movies, television (most notably The Sopranos and Glee) and pop culture in general. In November 2008, it became the first song to be downloaded 2 million times from iTunes. Three years later, it was the top-selling catalogue track in iTunes history, with over 5 million digital copies sold.
      This is one of 12 tracks re-recorded by the band with their new vocalist Arnel Pineda for their 2008 double album Revelation.

    <cite id="cite2"><sup></sup> This song was written and recorded by the Dutch brothers Rob and Ferdi Bolland in 1981. Five years later, the British rock band Status Quo covered it as the title track of their 1986 album. Despite being completely different to Quo’s usual 12-bar boogie format,<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> it was released as a single. It proved to be an astute move as the song became one of the group’s biggest ever selling hits, peaking at #2 in the UK and topping several charts in Europe, including those of Austria, Germany and Switzerland.

    <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
    <p>Rising up, back on the street<br>
    Did my time, took my chances<br>
    Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet<br>
    Just a man and his will to survive<br>
    So many times it happens too fast<br>
    You trade your passion for glory<br>
    Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past<br>
    You must fight just to keep them alive</p>

    Stalks his prey in the night<br>
    And he's watching us all<br>
